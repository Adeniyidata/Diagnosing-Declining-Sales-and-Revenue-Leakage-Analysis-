 📌**Project Title:**  Diagnosing Declining Sales and Revenue Leakage Analysis in a Retail E-Commerce Company

  **1. Introduction:**
This project analyzes declining sales performance and revenue leakage in a retail e-commerce company over the period **2018–2022**. The goal was to identify root causes of revenue decline, quantify inefficiencies, and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve net revenue, margins, and sales sustainability.

**2. Tools Used:**
•	Microsoft Excel
o	Power Query
o	Power Pivot
o	Pivot Tables
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
•	Data Modeling & KPI Reporting Techniques

**3. Core KPIs Used:**
•	Total Revenue
•	Net Revenue
•	Average Discount (%)
•	Discount-to-Revenue Ratio
•	Revenue by Product
•	Revenue by Country
•	Revenue by Month, Quarter, and Year

**4. Data Preparation:**
•	Imported raw transactional sales data into Excel
•	Standardized column formats (dates, currency, percentages)
•	Validated data completeness and consistency before transformation

**5. Data Cleaning in Power Query:**
•	Removed duplicates and null values
•	Corrected data types for date and numeric fields
•	Merged supporting tables where required
•	Ensured clean, analysis-ready datasets for modeling

**6. Date Table Creation:**
•	Created a dedicated Date Table to support time-intelligence analysis
•	Ensured continuous date coverage across the full analysis period

**7. Added Date Attributes:**
Derived additional columns to enable seasonal and trend analysis:
•	Year
•	Month
•	Quarter
•	Day of Week

**8. Data Modeling in Power Pivot:**
•	Built a star-schema data model
•	Established relationships between fact tables and dimension tables
•	Optimized model structure for performance and scalability

**9. DAX Measures & Pivot Tables:**
Created DAX measures to support KPI tracking and analysis, including:
•	Total Revenue
•	Net Revenue
•	Average Discount
•	Revenue Growth Trends
•	Discount Impact Analysis
Used Pivot Tables to visualize performance across time, products, and geographies

**10. Root Causes of Declining Sales & Revenue Leakage**:
The analysis identifies four primary drivers:
1.	Inefficient discount strategy (non-targeted, low ROI)
2.	Underperforming product lines absorbing sales focus
3.	Missed seasonal optimization opportunities
4.	Lack of margin-based decision-making
These factors collectively suppress net revenue despite stable demand.

**11. Insights & Recommendations:**
**Key Insights:**
•	Sales decline followed predictable seasonal patterns
•	Blanket discounting caused margin erosion without consistent revenue gains
•	A small group of products generated most revenue
•	Revenue decline was systemic, not country-specific

**12. Recommendations:**
•	Implement targeted, ROI-driven discount strategies
•	Focus promotions on weak demand periods (Q1, Q4)
•	Prioritize high-margin, high-performing products
•	Strengthen revenue governance using recurring KPI reviews

**13. Conclusion:**
The analysis revealed that declining sales and revenue leakage were driven by internal strategic inefficiencies rather than external market factors. By refining discount practices, optimizing the product portfolio, and aligning campaigns with demand patterns, the business can improve net revenue, protect margins, and restore sustainable growth.
